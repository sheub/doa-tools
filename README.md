## What is `doa-tools`

A set of MATLAB functions for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation related
applications, including basic array designs, various DOA estimators, and tools
to compute performance bounds. It serves as a small toolbox for my research
related to array signal processing.

## What has been implemented

* Several array designs and difference coarray related functions.
* Commonly used DOA estimators including MVDR beamformer, MUSIC, and root-MUSIC.
* Sparsity-based DOA estimator.
* Functions to compute the [Cram√©r-Rao bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound).
* Functions to visualize the estimation results.
* Several useful utility functions, including a simple progress bar to display
  the simulation progress.
